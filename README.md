# Videos-of-the-2021-Ridge-Seminar-Series

The Ridge Seminar Series will target a global audience interested in all aspects and disciplines around and related to mid-ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres. The series targets both the ridge community and a broader scientific audience, and in particular early career researchers.

The seminars will take place bi-weekly, starting January 12th 2021, and will be recorded and made available on-line (details on access to video records will be provided in the “Past seminars’ page). Time will vary to allow seminars that are compatible with schedules in both EU-USA and EU-Asia.

**Abstract**   
The oceanic crust is continuously renewed by melt accumulation and extensive tectonics at the ridge axis. The main factors controlling this growth process are spreading rate, local mantle potential temperature and fertility of the mantle source. The interplay between these factors defines the degree of partial melting undergone by the rising mantle, which in turns represents the amount of melt delivered to the ridge axis. The zero age variability of both mantle source composition and crustal thickness has been densely measured along the entire oceanic ridge system. Little is known, however, on the temporal evolution of crustal-building processes at single ridge segments over the million-year time scale. Combining geophysical, geochemical and petrological data has revealed multiscale fluctuations of the melting process over the 26 Ma-long lithospheric section exposed at the Vema transform region, at 11° N in the Atlantic Ocean. Based on this record, we inferred the thermal control played by fusible heterogeneities on the melting process. The presence of low-solidus lithologies exerts a cooling effect on the melting region overriding the variations induced by changes in spreading rate. This effect is visible along the global ridge system as shown by the (lack of-) correlation between melting indicators inferred from mantle residua and spatially associated basalts. It appears that source heterogeneities-driven thermal effects play a major control in defining the magmatic thickness of the oceanic crust and the inferred apparent mantle potential temperature. The study of Myr-long temporal series is a fundamental step to discriminate between the parameters controlling the present-day structure and thickness of the oceanic crust.
