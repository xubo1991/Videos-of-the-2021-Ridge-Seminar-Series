# Videos-of-the-2021-Ridge-Seminar-Series

The Ridge Seminar Series will target a global audience interested in all aspects and disciplines around and related to mid-ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres. The series targets both the ridge community and a broader scientific audience, and in particular early career researchers.

The seminars will take place bi-weekly, starting January 12th 2021, and will be recorded and made available on-line (details on access to video records will be provided in the “Past seminars’ page). Time will vary to allow seminars that are compatible with schedules in both EU-USA and EU-Asia.

For more details of the seminar, please refer to https://ridgeseminarseries.wordpress.com.


```However, the video records are posted on a Youtube channel at present, which is not accessible in many countries. Thus, I upload these videos to Baidu netdisk, and share the download links below. If you are interested in these talks, please feel free to download.```
