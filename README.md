# Videos-of-the-2021-Ridge-Seminar-Series

The Ridge Seminar Series will target a global audience interested in all aspects and disciplines around and related to mid-ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres. The series targets both the ridge community and a broader scientific audience, and in particular early career researchers.

The seminars will take place bi-weekly, starting January 12th 2021, and will be recorded and made available on-line (details on access to video records will be provided in the “Past seminars’ page). Time will vary to allow seminars that are compatible with schedules in both EU-USA and EU-Asia.

## Agenda
**Talk 1: “The importance of (long) temporal series to unravel the source control on the thickness and composition of the oceanic crust”**

**Abstract**   
The oceanic crust is continuously renewed by melt accumulation and extensive tectonics at the ridge axis. The main factors controlling this growth process are spreading rate, local mantle potential temperature and fertility of the mantle source. The interplay between these factors defines the degree of partial melting undergone by the rising mantle, which in turns represents the amount of melt delivered to the ridge axis. The zero age variability of both mantle source composition and crustal thickness has been densely measured along the entire oceanic ridge system. Little is known, however, on the temporal evolution of crustal-building processes at single ridge segments over the million-year time scale. Combining geophysical, geochemical and petrological data has revealed multiscale fluctuations of the melting process over the 26 Ma-long lithospheric section exposed at the Vema transform region, at 11° N in the Atlantic Ocean. Based on this record, we inferred the thermal control played by fusible heterogeneities on the melting process. The presence of low-solidus lithologies exerts a cooling effect on the melting region overriding the variations induced by changes in spreading rate. This effect is visible along the global ridge system as shown by the (lack of-) correlation between melting indicators inferred from mantle residua and spatially associated basalts. It appears that source heterogeneities-driven thermal effects play a major control in defining the magmatic thickness of the oceanic crust and the inferred apparent mantle potential temperature. The study of Myr-long temporal series is a fundamental step to discriminate between the parameters controlling the present-day structure and thickness of the oceanic crust.  

### Talk 2: “A dynamic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary dictated by variations in melt generation and migration: Insights from the PI-LAB experiment at the Equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge”**    
*Time: 2021/01/26*  
*Speaker: Nick Harmon (Univ. of Southampton, UK)*

**Abstract**   
In plate tectonic theory a weak asthenosphere is required to facilitate the motions of the rigid plates. Partial melt could weaken the mantle, in turn impacting convection, but to date the existence of persistent melt has remained controversial. A wide range of scenarios have been reported in terms of the location, amount and pathways of melt. We use a combination of seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) data, with a range of resolutions and sensitivities, to image 0 – 80 Myr old lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere near the equatorial Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We image a tectonic plate thickness that increases with age in one location but undulates in another location. We image thin and slightly thicker melt channels and punctuated regions of ascending partial melt several hundred kilometres off the ridge axis. This suggests melt persists over geologic timescales, although its character is dynamic, with implications for the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and the driving forces of the plates. Ascending melt intermittently feeds melt channels at the base of the plate. The associated melt-enhanced buoyancy increases the influence of ridge-push in driving plate motions; whereas, the channelized melt reduces the resistance of the plates to motion. This suggests melt dynamics plays a larger role in controlling plate tectonics than previously thought.
