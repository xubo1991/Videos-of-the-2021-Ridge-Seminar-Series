# Videos-of-the-2021-Ridge-Seminar-Series
The Ridge Seminar Series will target a global audience interested in all aspects and disciplines around and related to mid-ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres. The series targets both the ridge community and a broader scientific audience, and in particular early career researchers.

The seminars will take place bi-weekly, starting January 12th 2021, and will be recorded and made available on-line (details on access to video records will be provided in the “Past seminars’ page). Time will vary to allow seminars that are compatible with schedules in both EU-USA and EU-Asia.

This Seminar Series is collegially animated and managed by:
Christoph BEIER (U. Helsinki, Finland)
J. P. CANALES (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, USA)
Ana COLAÇO (university of Azores, Portugal)
Javier ESCARTIN (CNRS-Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris, France)
Chuanzhou LIU (Institute of Geology and Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China)
Marjolaine MATABOS (IFREMER, France)
Neil MITCHELL (U. Manchester, UK)
Min XU (South China Sea Institute of Oceanolgy , China)

However, the video records are posted on a Youtube channel at present, which is not accessible in many countries. Thus, I upload these videos to Baidu netdisk, and share the download links below. If you are interested in these topics, please feel free to download.
